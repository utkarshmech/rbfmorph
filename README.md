# Rbfmorph
A Robust mesh morphing Algorithm based on Radial Basis Function.
## Installation:
### From source
- Clone the repo into your local directory
- Point the PYTHONPATH to the directory
### Note 
The overpackage is still breaking and unstable. Still under development. If possible, I'll soon write a tutorial.
## The RBF jupyter Notebooks:
- These notebooks contain the demo implementations for RBF mesh morphing. While the results can also be utilized to understand the code with the help of comments.
- These were complied in my local environment and may not run in other python environments.
